# JavaScript-Password-Generator-

#Description 

The client frequently has to access sensitive data and would like to ensure high level security to all of his employees. 
They wanted like an application that randomly generates strong passwords base on defined criteria ensuring company security policies. Specific criteria for the password include having a length of 8-128 characters, lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special character types, for each prompt to be validated after selection, and for the generated password that matches the selected criteria to be displayed on the page. In the future, we may look into reworking the prompts into checkbox selections to improve user experience.

#Usage 
1. Open the password generator URL in your browser. 
2. Generate a strong safe random password by clicking the "Generate Password" button and confirming the prompts.
